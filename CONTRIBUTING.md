# Contributing

Only members of the smoodify team will be contributing directly to this project's code. Suggestions and ideas are welcomed and encouraged, and you may contact a member of the team with this information, if you so desire. 

Please follow the code of conduct found below. Treat it as gospel when interacting with one another. 

## Process for Pull Requests

1. Before doing anything, create an Issue on GitHub to describe what you would like to do. These Issues should be as discussed in the product or sprint backlog. 
2. To begin working on an issue, create a branch named after your issue number, e.g. "#2". Make sure to include the quotes when making the branch on the terminal. Add the appropriate labels, project, and milestone to this issue and update the sprint's task board accordingly.
3. All changes should be built into your branch. When adding to the repository, please ensure that you only add the files that you made changes to. Adding all could result in someone else's commit being over written. Better yet, pull before you push. 
4. Create a pull request to the **development** branch titled after the issue number followed by a short description of what the pull request is changing, e.g. "#2 Added CONTRIBUTING.md". These wil be reviewed by other developers as well as the scrum master. Once your changes have been confirmed by the scrum master, as well as another developer, the pull request will be accepted into the development branch, the issue will be closed, and the associated branch will be deleted.
5. At the end of the sprint, the scrum master will merge the development branch with the master branch.

* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions

when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of

address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
